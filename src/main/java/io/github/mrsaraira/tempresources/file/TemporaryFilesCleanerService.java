/**
 * Service to automatically clean temporary files in pre-defined lifetime scope.
 * <br>
 * Temporary files - are files that eventually will be deleted. These files don't have to be placed in temp/ directory.
 * This service registers temporary files and directories by default in
 * {@link TemporaryResourceLifetimeScope#APPLICATION APPLICATION} scope, or by predefining temporary
 * file lifetime scope after which it will be removed.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Once the temporary file is registered for deletion, <b>it cannot be undone</b>.<br>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> This service works for both files and directories.
